\item Το \en \cmdbs{includegraphics} \gr δέχεται προαιρετικά ορίσματα που σας επιτρέπουν να μετασχηματίσετε το
εικόνα όταν περιλαμβάνεται. Για παράδειγμα, το \en \bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}}\gr \space κάνει την εικόνα να καταλαμβάνει το 30\% του πλάτους του περιβάλλοντος κειμένου \en(\cmdbs{textwidth})\gr.

\subsection{Πίνακες}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Οι πίνακες στο \LaTeX{} χρειάζονται λίγη εξοικείωση.
\item Χρησιμοποιήστε το περιβάλλον \en \bftt{tabular}\gr \spaceαπό το πακέτο \en \bftt{tabularx}\gr.
\item 
Το όρισμα καθορίζει τη στοίχιση στηλών --- \en \textbf{l}eft, \textbf{r}right, \textbf{r}right \gr.
\en
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\
Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\gr
\item Χρησιμοποιήστε το\en \cmdbs{hline} \gr για οριζόντιες γραμμές.
\en
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\\hline

Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\gr
\item Χρησιμοποιήστε ένα συμπλεκτικό σύμβολο \keystrokebftt{\&} για να διαχωρίσετε στήλες και μια διπλή ανάστροφη κάθετο \en \keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs} \gr για να ξεκινήσετε μια νέα σειρά.

\begin{itemize}
\item Τοποθετήστε τις αναφορές σας σε ένα αρχείο \en \bftt{.bib}\gr \space σε μορφή βάσης δεδομένων \en «bibtex»:
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}\gr

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\en\insertsubsection{}\gr 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Κάθε καταχώρηση στο αρχείο \en\bftt{.bib} \gr έχει ένα \en \emph{key} \gr για το οποίο μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε
αναφερθείτε στο έγγραφο. Για παράδειγμα, το \en \bftt{Jacobson1999Towards}\gr \spaceείναι το κλειδί για αυτό το άρθρο:
\en
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
  author = {Van Jacobson},
  ...
}
\end{minted}
\gr
\item Είναι καλή ιδέα να χρησιμοποιήσετε ένα κλειδί με βάση το όνομα, το έτος και τον τίτλο.
\item Το \LaTeX{} μπορεί να μορφοποιήσει αυτόματα τις αναφορές εντός κειμένου και να δημιουργήσει ένα
κατάλογος αναφορών, γνωρίζει τα περισσότερα τυπικά στυλ αλλά μπορείτε να σχεδιάσετε και το δικό σας.

% -- latex understands words, sentences and paragraphs

Words are separated by one or more spaces.  Paragraphs are separated by
one or more blank lines.  The output is not affected by adding extra
spaces or extra blank lines to the input file.

Double quotes are typed like this: ``quoted text''.
Single quotes are typed like this: `single-quoted text'.

Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
Bold       text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

-- Figures

- Need the graphicx package.

- here we can start introducing options
